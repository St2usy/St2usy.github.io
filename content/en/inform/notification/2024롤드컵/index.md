On January 4, 2024, Riot's official announcement revealed 20 seeds, and on September 9, each seed pool was announced.

The difference from the previous year's Walls was that it was reduced from 22 teams to 20 teams, and after the consolidation of several minor leagues implemented last year, the LJL was also integrated into the PCS, and the seed of the WQS disappeared again to match the play-in participants.

By detailed pool, LCK&LPL has recently overwhelmed LEC&LCS in all international competitions, so the LEC and LCS 3 seeds have been demoted to start with the play-in stage instead of the existing Swiss stage direct seeds. In addition, as only 12 teams returned to the Swiss stage directly, the number of teams that can come up from the play-in stage has increased to four out of eight.
