Stush is a brand created by CREW, who is crazy about surfboards called SHOWN STUSSY in 1980. Stush's unique logo is the logo created by SHOWN STUSSY's uncle and has become an indispensable brand of streetwear now, but Stush's beginning was a small brand that started in California when he made T-shirts and surfboards. Stush's success factor is always open mind, interacting with boarders and DJs in Tokyo, London, New York, and taking their culture as the concept and adopting the DIY spirit of British punk in the 1970s and 1980s, it has become an independent brand that all street culture lovers admire.
